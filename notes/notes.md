## Coding for Geospecific Disasters

### Types of Disasters
- [ ] fracking earthquakes
- [x] hurricanes
- [x] rising sea level
- [x] wildfires
- [ ] tsunamis
- [ ] tornadoes
- [x] droughts
- [x] heatwaves
- [x] floods
- [x] storms
- [x] mudslides
- [ ] melting ice

### How to Code for Disasters
* 1 (West Coast) = hurricanes, sea level, wildfire, tsunamis, droughts, heatwaves, floods, storms, mudslides,earthquakes
* 2 (Disney) = theme parks
* 3 (Florida) = sea levels, hurricanes 
* 4 (East Coast) = wildfire, hurricanes, droughts, heatwaves, wildfire
* 5 (Gulf Coast) = hurricanes, floods, storms, Gulf disasters
* 6 (Arctic) = melting ice, heatwaves
* 7 (Hawaii) = wildfires, sea level, droughts, heatwaves
