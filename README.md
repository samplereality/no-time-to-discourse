# no-time-to-discourse

_No Time to Discourse_ is a speculative atlas that explores
climate disasters across North America through interactive mapping
and generative flash fiction.

## About the Project

_No Time to Discourse_ follows Rita Raley's call for electronic literature
that narrativizes data (<q>Machine Writing: Translation, Generation,
Automation,</q> Electronic Literature Organization, University of Porto, July
2017). Each of the millions of possible stories is a work of fiction, yet each also attempts to
capture at a human level the facts of climate disaster. The maps are powered by Leaflet.js and Stamen Design's CC BY 4.0 watercolor map tiles. The stories are procedurally generated by Rita.js, based on extensive rules written by Mark Sample. The <a href="https://github.com/samplereality/no-time-to-discourse">code for the project</a> is available under a GPLv3 license.
