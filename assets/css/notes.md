# Notes

## Coding for Geospecific Disasters

### Types of Disasters
* fracking earthquakes
* hurricanes
* rising sea level
* wildfires
* tsunamis
* tornadoes
* droughts
* heatwaves
* floods
* storms
* mudslides

### How to Code for Disasters
* 1 (California) = hurricanes, sea level, wildfire, tsunamis, droughts, heatwaves, floods, storms, mudslides,earthquakes
* 2 = wildfire, droughts, heatwaves, floods, storms, earthquakes
* 3 (Florida) = wildfire, droughts, heatwaves, floods, storms 
* 4 (East Coast) = wildfire, hurricanes, droughts, heatwaves, wildfire
* 5 = storms, floods, rising sea level
